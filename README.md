# Analysis of Low Salinity Waterflooding

Low-salinity waterflooding (LSWF) is a potential new method for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in sandstone
and carbonate rock formations. LSWF approach has gained an attention in the oil and gas industry due to its potential advantages over the
conventional waterflooding and other chemical EOR technologies.
We did a graphical analysis of the variation of the Oil recovery as we vary the salinity of the water.
